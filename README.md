# DataCache - lightweight & private client data

DataCache is part of a series of packages I have developed personally for usage in my template game that I use for fast-build commission works. It is designed to work with a specific hierarchy of RemoteEvents and RemoteFunctions, as documented in the source code. I am not in a place to release all of these packages, but I can release this one. These packages (this one included) are designed for rapid development of commission works.

#### Wally Dependency
`datacache = "summerequinox/datacache@1.0.2""`

#### API
Official documentation is not yet prepared for DataCache.
